# Islands
A 2D Survival Tile-based game in Unity

## TODO
- Chunk Loading based on position
- Custom tile Collider at runtime
- WorldGen using perlin noise (fix negative being reflected)
- Standardize positions names, there are too many different names for same thing (tile/world/global, chunk, local/relative, etc.)
