# Islands
A 2D Survival Tile-based game in Unity

## TODO
- Make ChunkData use localPosition (perhaps restrict all of it using custom functions and make ChunkData private)
- Chunk Loading based on position
- Fix issue (or wait for Unity Fix) where TileMap's Colliders don't update at runtime
- WorldGen using perlin noise (fix negative being reflected)
